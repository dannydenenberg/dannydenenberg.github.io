If you're reading this and are planning on taking the gibbush, let me say this: never quit, never give up! At the very least, don't give them the satisfaction. Also, it isn't overly difficult. Remember: the pain you feel is only temporary, literally only for those few minutes. Don't regret not giving it your all just to get back into your comfort zone. You're in the military now: you will never be comfortable. Just keep on trucking. And anything you try your best at, you feel great about later. A little pain now can pay dividends later. For me, even if I don't make Tzanchanim, I am proud of my performance. I tried hard and I think I stood out. Hopefully I'll find out in the next couple days.
