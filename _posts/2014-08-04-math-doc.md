**All math on denenberg.us is rendered using [Katex](https://katex.org)**

Here's some inline \\(5x=33x^2-8\pi\\) math.

Here's some display math:
$
\int^{88}\_\infty \frac{x^2}{\pi^4 x} \dot dx = 4
$

- To write math inline, enclose the math in `\(` to start and `\)` to end. Ex: `\(a=\frac{F}{m}\)`
  - **Note** that when writing this in Jekyll markdown, you actually have to type 2 backslashes becuase the first acts as an escape character: `\\(a=\frac{F}{m}\\)`
- To write display math, enclose the math in a single dollar sign: `$a=\frac{F}{m}$`
  - Why not 2 dollar signs you ask? It turns out that before Katex can even get to the math, if you are using 2 dollar signs the **markdown parser turns it into a script tag**...so not ideal.
