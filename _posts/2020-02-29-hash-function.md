Us programmers (and some other chosen few, e.g. [number theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory)) probably are familiar with a hash function in some way. If you have ever used an object in JavaScript, you have at the very least used a data structure utilizing hash functions:

```js
const a = {
  "hash?": true
};
```

!!H=\sigma(X\times W{ih})=\begin{bmatrix} \sigma (x_1w{11}+x2w{21}) \\\\ \sigma(x1w{12}+x2w{22}) \\\\ \sigma (x1w{13}+x2w{23})\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} h_1 \\\\ h_2 \\\\ h_3 \end{bmatrix} \\\\!!

!!h(k) \equiv k\ (\textrm{mod}\ m)!!
