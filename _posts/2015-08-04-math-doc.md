**All math on dannydenenberg.com is rendered using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)**

Here's some inline $5x=33x^2-8\pi$ math.

Here's some display math:
!!
\int^{88}\_\infty \frac{x^2}{\pi^4 x} \dot dx = 4
!!

- To write math inline, enclose the math in `$` to start and `$` to end. Ex: `$a=\frac{F}{m}$`
- To write display math, enclose the math in double exclamation marks like so: `!!a=\frac{F}{m}!!`
  - Why not 2 dollar signs you ask? It turns out that before MathJax can even get to the math, if you are using 2 dollar signs the **markdown parser turns it into a script tag**......SO not ideal ðŸ™„.
