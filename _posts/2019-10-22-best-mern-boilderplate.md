[Here](https://github.com/dannydenenberg/MERN-boilerplate-login-system) is all of the MERN code.

About two years ago, 'Kieth the Coder' (Youtuber) released [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1swJLYxLAA) video on creating a login system using the MERN stack (Mongodb, Express, React, Node). I watched it and loved it. However, I searched and searched, yet couldn't find the code that he wrote in the actual video.

This frustrated me A TON, so....I typed it all out and fixed a couple of errors that were present in the video. It is a great boilerplate for anyone wanting to use Webpack to make a MERN login system. **[Here](https://github.com/dannydenenberg/MERN-boilerplate-login-system) is the code in its entirety.** All instructions on running the app are in the README.md.
