### [MERN Boilerplate Login](https://github.com/dannydenenberg/Material-ui-MERN-boilerplate)

Full-stack complete boilerplate code using **Mongo, Express, React, and Node.js**. Includes hashing, salting, encrypted requests, and Material UI for styling. The client and server run from the same port (proxied).

### [Starlight](https://github.com/dannydenenberg/Starlight)

A "hackable" üë®‚Äçüíª **voice command system** designed to run on a Raspberry Pi or similar Linux/Unix based systems. Written using Python and Google's Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs to make it simple and easy to add, remove, or edit commands. Utilizes the face_recognition python library for simple detection. Full documentation on the GithHub repo. I worked on this project during part of my time working at Gallup, Inc.

More will be added to this page soon!
