> Hey yall! I'm workin' on developing this site into a beautiful flower ðŸŒº (btw, want this theme? [Here ya go!](https://github.com/dannydenenberg/newcomen))

I'm an award winning musician, singer, and actor from Omaha, NE :) (I also do a bit of coding on the side)

I am CRAZY about website themes, and like to develop my own, like this one here. It is heavily inspired by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo) who is a great designer. If you're interested in my other themes, some are currently on github (like my [ghost-tufte](https://github.com/dannydenenberg/ghost-tufte) ghost theme) and others will be uploaded in the future.

I also have done some study into the mathematical underworkings of nerual nets as well as database-client relationships in Node.js/Typescript/JavaScript. Some of those findings/explanations you can find [here](https://medium.com/@dannydenenberg).

### How the hell can I get in touch with this guy??

Email sure works in a jiffy.....`danny@denenberg.com`
