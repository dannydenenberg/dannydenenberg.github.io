title: About
---

Danny Denenberg is an award winning actor, singer, musician, and software dev @ [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/home.aspx). He lives in [Omaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska), the silicon valley of the midwest with his crazy family. In 2016, Danny won the National Modern Woodment of America speech contest out of 93,000 participants across the U.S. -- just an interesting tid bit.

He is way too passionate about music and spends more time than he should playing [Scott Joplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin) rags or [Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach) preludes and fugues. If you ever want to get him started talking non stop about something, please mention the latter (really, try it).

Although he doesn't wear a kippah all of the time, Danny is a practicing [Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) (yes that's possible) and you can often find him looking up different arrangements of the [prayer for the state of israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_for_the_Welfare_of_the_State_of_Israel) or some variant of a familiar synagogue tune.

**DANGER**: Mentioning lyrics from ANY musical in front of Danny may result in that song being sung.....with choreography.
