  <div class="column2">I was born in Omaha, NE during a snowy January, a day after J.R.R. Tolkien’s eleventy-first birthday. The oldest of five in a big Jewish family, my childhood included much kvelling and kvetching over my meshugenah siblings.</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column1">Music.</div>
  <div class="column2">My love affair. I used to sing myself to sleep when I was 2, 3, 4 years old. It’s turned into theater and vocal competitions and classical piano and guitar and even singing for Katy Perry (you can ask me about that one later).</div>

  <div class="column1">Now.</div>
  <div class="column2">On a year off before college. I will be living in Tel Aviv starting late January working as a Data Scientist Intern for Big ID. 
  
  <br/><br/>I just finished being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_France">Hal France</a>’s musical assistant at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
<br/><br/>
I worked at Sanborn Western Camps for three months this past summer as an Outdoor Educator and Trip Leader, taking kids up 14-ers, hanging with the awesome other counselors, and scrubbing toilets and dishes non-stop (kids eat and s**** alot—who’d-a thunk it?).</div>

<!-- In late January of 2022, I'll be living in Tel Aviv working for [Big ID](https://bigid.com/) as a Data Science Intern.

The summer of 2021, I worked for [Sanborn](https://www.sanbornwesterncamps.com/) as a camp counselor in Colorado. I led 13-year-olds up 14,000 foot mountains, took them on 4-day camping trips, mitigated interpersonal disputes, held nightly meetings for two months, and cleaned more dishes and toilets than I care to discuss.

Currently I am on a gap year before attending [Harvard](https://college.harvard.edu/) where I will most likely study Computer Science. Secondaries I am considering are Jewish studies, government, and music--we will see what I choose!

I love love love music and piano and singing and I'll talk your ear off about Joplin rags and Bach piano concertos if you let me. I'm also a [Bikram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikram_Yoga) yogi. There's nothing else like it!
