Danny Denenberg is an award winning [actor, singer, musician](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b29B0QrxZei-Fpmv96fJhEw-qyBjV3AQ/view?usp=sharing), and software dev @ [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/home.aspx). He lives in [Omaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska), the silicon valley of the midwest (hell yeah üßê), with his crazy family. In 2016, Danny [won](http://www.jewishomaha.org/jewish-press/2015/06/danny-goes-national/) the National Modern Woodmen of America speech contest out of 93,000 participants across the US -- just an interesting tid bit.

He is way too passionate about music and spends more time than he should playing [Scott Joplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin) rags or [Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach) preludes and fugues. If you ever want to get him started talking non stop about something, please mention the latter (really, try it).

Just to clear up any would-be confusion, Danny **is** related to some other Denenbergs that have websites, namely [Larry](http://larry.denenberg.com/) and [Steve](http://www.facialsurgery.com/PPghome_page).

I am a writer for [Alligator.io](https://alligator.io/author/danny-denenberg), and my posts have also been published in a few Medium publications such as [BecomingHuman.ai](https://becominghuman.ai/@DannyDenenberg), [Better Programming, and The Startup](https://medium.com/@DannyDenenberg). Interestingly enough, one of my posts has actually been [translated into Russian](https://bulldogjob.pl/news/801-rust-oczami-programisty-javascript) ü§®üéâ...
