I'm an award winning musician, singer, and actor from Omaha, NE :) I also do quite a bit of coding on the side (and as a software dev @ [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/home.aspx)).

If you're interested in my website themes, some are currently on github like my [ghost-tufte](https://github.com/dannydenenberg/ghost-tufte) ðŸ‘» blog theme and the code to [this website](https://github.com/dannydenenberg/dannydenenberg.github.io).
