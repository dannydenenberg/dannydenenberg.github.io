### Contact Information

**Phone**: `650-793-0157` *(text or call)*<br>
**E-mail**: `danny@denenberg.com`

I am currently accepting requests for freelance work. Please check my about page for more information on the technologies I am versed in.

### What the heck do you do?

Hi. I'm Danny. I'm skilled at writing **quick software solutions** to help sift through technical data or to automate a task related to software on your computer (email, desktop applications, etc). I can also help with your hardware issues. 

### I'm older, I need help with my tech in general...

Great! My first job was helping older folks with technology!

I write personalized, easy to read technology manuals. This way when it's time to search the web or check your email, you have detailed steps to make the process simple.
